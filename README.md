# Email Classification and Reply System

## Overview

This project is a Flask web application that integrates with Gmail and Googleâ€™s generative AI to classify and generate replies to emails. The application allows users to fetch emails from their Gmail account, classify them into categories, and generate automated replies using Google's AI model.

## Features

- **Authenticate with Gmail**: Securely authenticate and access Gmail using OAuth 2.0.
- **Fetch Emails**: Retrieve emails from the Gmail inbox.
- **Classify Emails**: Use Google's AI model to classify emails into categories (Interested, Not Interested, More Information).
- **Generate Replies**: Automatically generate email replies based on the classification.
- **Send Replies**: Send generated replies back through Gmail.
